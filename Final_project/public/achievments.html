    I am glad to come to Westminster College this afternoon, and am complimented that you should give me a degree.
    The name "Westminster" is somehow familiar to me. I seem to have heard of it before. Indeed, it was at Westminster that
    I received a very large part of my education in politics, dialectic,
    rhetoric, and one or two other things. In fact we have both been educated at
    the same, or similar, or, at any rate, kindred establishments.
    <br><br>
    It is also an honour, perhaps almost unique, for a private visitor to be introduced to an
    academic audience by the President of the United States. Amid his heavy burdens, duties,
    and responsibilities - unsought but not recoiled from - the President has travelled a
    thousand miles to dignify and magnify our meeting here to-day and to give me an opportunity
    of addressing this kindred nation, as well as my own countrymen across the ocean, and perhaps some other countries too. The President has told you that it is his wish, as I am sure it is yours, that I should have full liberty to give my true and faithful counsel in these anxious and baffling times. I shall certainly avail myself of this freedom, and feel the more right to do so because any private ambitions I may have cherished in my younger days have been satisfied beyond my wildest dreams. Let me, however, make it clear that I have no official mission or status of any kind, and that I speak only for myself. There is nothing here but what you see.

    I can therefore allow my mind, with the experience of a lifetime, to play over the problems which beset us on
    the morrow of our absolute victory in arms, and to try to make sure with what strength I have that what has been gained
    with so much sacrifice and suffering shall be preserved for the future glory and safety of mankind.

    The United States stands at this time at the pinnacle of world power. It is a solemn moment for the American Democracy.
    For with primacy in power is also joined an awe-inspiring accountability to the future.
    If you look around you, you must feel not only the sense of duty done but also you must feel anxiety lest you
    fall below the level of achievement. Opportunity is here now, clear and shining for both our countries.
    To reject it or ignore it or fritter it away will bring upon us all the long reproaches of the after-time.
    It is necessary that constancy of mind, persistency of purpose, and the grand simplicity of decision shall guide and rule
    the conduct of the English-speaking peoples in peace as they did in war. We must, and I believe we shall, prove ourselves equal to this severe requirement.
